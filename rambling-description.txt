= Parse description text.

Generate a group number for each heading add allowed options to it (including options defined in groups in header).

We will need a class that, for a verb string returns help text.

e.g. GetCommandInfo(params string[] verbs);

= Parsing the command line itself.

* All verbs come first and together on the command line. It is NOT possible to have 

    command verb option subverb
    
* Optional subverbs are not allowed. For example git worktree requires add, remove, list or move. This means
  we can immediately report bad verbs without considering the possibility that they might be parameters.
  
* We use the verbs specified on the command line to descend the tree until we reach an integer.
